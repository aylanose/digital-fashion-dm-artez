				<p><h2>HOW <cite>Digital Fashion</cite> COULD REPLACE FAST FASHION, AND THE STARTUP PAVING THE WAY:</h2></p>
				<blockquote>
				The fashion industry is going through a somewhat painful transition from analog to digital, induced by the coronavirus pandemic and the relentless rise in global temperatures, triggering climate change an increasing pressure on the industry to become more sustainable. To continue to trade in the face of these challenges, fashion brands have adopted digital methods of prototyping, thereby reducing waste and lead times and streamlining physical production post-lockdown. While such global brands adapt, other fashion industry visionaries are reinventing. Viewing the current fashion industry challenges within the context of shifting consumer desires and online behaviors, two fashion entrepreneurs are devising an entirely new business model for fashion consumption, with no physical outputs. The model is the culmination of the learnings of two fashion entrepreneurs who spearheaded Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in Kyiv, Ukraine, propelling emerging fashion designers from around the globe into international boutiques via their B2B wholesale fashion showroom, More Dash.</blockquote>

				<hr>
			    <p>
			    From their industry vantage point, founders Daria Shapovalova and Natalia Modenova have witnessed a rapidly changing fashion market since launching the More Dash wholesale showroom, headquartered in Paris, in 2014. In their first B2C fashion venture in 2019 they launched More Dash pop up shops in the US (firstly in LA) as an AB test for this hypothesis: there is a significant demand for fashion ‚Äòconsumption‚Äô for the sole purpose of digital content creation, meaning that purchasing and physical ownership for these ‚Äòconsumers‚Äô is at least partially redundant.

			    <blockquote>
				Recognizing the growing ‚Äòpurchase, Instagram, return‚Äô trend the More Dash pop-ups were set up as content creation studios with stock from their wholesale showrooms. Visitors paid $10 to dress up, take pictures, and create videos. Some purchased garments too‚Äîmany returning to buy after receiving online validation of their digital content wearing the item. Shapovalova and Modenova were essentially formalizing and supporting the behavior of a generation of consumers whose online persona requires constant newness while grappling with the climate impact of creating products that are barely worn before being discarded or resold. Shapovalova concluded that: <cite><mark>‚ÄúIf the images are digital, why do (we) need to buy fashion at all?‚Äù</mark></cite></blockquote>
			    <p>
			    <hr>
			    The concept of wearing digital-only clothing isn‚Äôt new to anyone aware of The Fabricant, Carlings, or who purchases skins in video games (which brands including Gucci and Nike NKE +0.2% are now beginning to capitalize on). However, replacing the existing multi-brand eCommerce shopping experience with solely digital clothing is. This is where Dress-X, Modenova, and Shapovalova‚Äôs startup, fill what they say is a growing gap. The gap takes the shape of digital clothing online and available to download, but lacking easy tools and services to wear it. Consider The Fabricant‚Äôs monthly release of a digital outfit, free to download (albeit in size XS) and without an easy method of adapting and ‚Äòwearing‚Äô it. This is where Dress-X steps in. The Fabricant‚Äôs digital fashion collections will now reside in the digital eCommerce store, where shoppers can purchase garments in the form of an image of themselves wearing the item. At the point of purchase, the shopper uploads a photo of themselves onto which the digital garment is placed, ready for them to share online. This mimics the experience of the brand Carlings digital fashion shop (not currently active), but with fashion collections from a growing number of global brands‚Äîsome of which sell both digital and physical clothing.

				<blockquote>
				During my interview with the founders, they explained that some of the brands they onboard do not use 3D digital design methods at all, and therefore require Dress-X to create the digital versions of their physical garments. Other brands are designing in 3D from the outset, so provide the digital assets ready for sale. What‚Äôs crucial here, confirmed Modenova, is that the digital garments respect the viability of physical ones. That‚Äôs to say they have to be working 3D objects that have a structure and form that could function in the physical realm. After all, this is fashion, not simply abstract enveloping of the body, so a certain level of reality is required to ensure the digital clothes are ‚Äòbelievable‚Äô. 

			    This plays well into the dual digital and physical demands of shoppers, as there will be an ongoing need for physical clothing, so the ability to make physical products from digital ones is key, according to Modenova.</blockquote>
				
			    <p>
			    Furthermore, in terms of translating fashion designs into digital clothing, Shapovalova recognizes that garment construction knowledge is needed to interpret fashion sketches into valid digital garments. This is influencing their hiring, as she stated the importance of the skills of ‚Äúpeople who come from a pattern cutting background‚Äù rather than simply a design background.</p>

				The Dress-X team is based in LA and consists of co-founders and co-owners Shapovalova and Modenova along with four 2D and 3D artists and technical designers. During the week we spoke, they were hiring three more team members. It has to be said that the current method of dressing shoppers is largely manual, requiring intensive work to create the correct drape of fabrics and fit of the garments on the 2D image. This is not imminently scalable, however, the founders are working on automated processes to dress shoppers to support scaling. There are significant limitations, however, with Modevova explaining that ‚Äúthe technology, in general, is not there yet to recognize a body to implement (digital dressing)‚Äîthe AI is not there to entirely automate this process.‚Äù However, rather than wait for technology to reach that stage, they decided to launch the project with 3D artists ‚Äòmanually‚Äô dressing the shoppers, with planned iterations to introduce automation over time.<cite><mark>‚ÄúAutomation is the most important (goal) for us,‚Äù</mark></cite> says Shapovalova, who revealed that their KPI is to sell ‚Äú1 billion digital items (with)in ten years.‚Äù There has been a rapid uptake of Dress-X since inception two weeks ago, with 2000 unique users on day 1 and a week after launch when we spoke, their orders were ‚Äúdoubling each day.‚Äù The turnaround time to digitally dress a shopper was 2 days, but is reducing.</blockquote>

				<p>
				A key facet of this business model and the message of Dress-X is summed up by Shapovalova: <cite><mark>‚ÄúDigital fashion is the new fast fashion. If we really want it fast, it should be digital.‚Äù</mark></cite></p>

			        <p>This brings us to the sustainability and relative carbon footprint (and therefore environmental impact) of digital versus physical clothing. This potential reduction in the impact of digital clothing isn‚Äôt just in the final product, but the design and sampling process, which when done digitally, offers marked reductions in resource use and textile waste. The founders have enlisted an external consultant to obtain and analyze data to accurately quantify the benefits of digital in place of physical ‚Äòfast-fashion‚Äô. The results of which I am eager to share, once available.</p>

			        <blockquote>
			        In the meantime, they have delved into some secondary research and appropriated some existing emissions data from a recent Ericsson Report. Their calculation is based on the Carbon Trust‚Äôs report that indicates a men‚Äôs white t-shirt is responsible for emitting 6.5kg of CO2e into the atmosphere, while in comparison, one hour is spent creating a digital garment, which requires energy that emits 0.312kg CO2e, leading to their indicative calculation that: ‚ÄúAt Dress-X, the total carbon footprint of producing one digital item is 95% less than the average production for a physical garment.‚Äù</blockquote>
			        <hr>
			        <blockquote>Whilst this may represent a somewhat simplified calculation of the processes and resources used in both instances, it gives an indicative figure for the magnitude of potential energy (and therefore carbon emission) reductions offered by digital design. Where this may begin to lose significance is if cloud computing for automated dressing goes to a significant scale, requiring an sharp upsurge in energy to power the algorithms to output the billion garment target. In this event, renewable energy sources to power this business model at scale will be crucial to maintaining the paradigm-shifting sustainability benefits of digital, in place of physical fashion.</blockquote>
